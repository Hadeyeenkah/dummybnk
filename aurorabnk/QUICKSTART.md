# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Start the Backend (Terminal 1)

```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

Keep this terminal running. You should see:
```
🚀 Server running on port 5000
⚠️  MongoDB connection failed: connect ECONNREFUSED...
Server will continue without database...
```

✅ The MongoDB warning is **expected** - server works without it for development!

## Start the Frontend (Terminal 2)

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Browser will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## Test the App

1. Click **"Get Started"** → Fill out signup form
2. Check your **backend terminal** for the verification link:
   ```
   [EMAIL] Verification to your@email.com: http://localhost:5000/api/auth/verify-email?token=abc123...
   ```
3. Copy that URL and paste it in your browser to verify email
4. Go back to app → Click **"Sign In"** → Login with your credentials
5. You're in! 🎉

## CORS Error Fix

If you see CORS errors in the browser console:

1. **Make sure backend is running** on port 5000
2. **Check** `backend/.env` has:
   ```
   CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
   ```
3. **Restart the backend server** (Ctrl+C, then `node server.js` again)
4. **Refresh** your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R to hard refresh)
